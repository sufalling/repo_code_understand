22,"Note: Parameters are similar to features and properties used in SAX2 [SAX]. ""schema-type"" [optional] A DOMString object containing an absolute URI and representing the type of the schema language used to validate a document against. Note that no lexical checking is done on the absolute URI. If this parameter is not set, a default value may be provided by the implementation, based on the schema languages supported and on the schema language used at load time. Note: For XML Schema [XML Schema Part 1], applications must use the value ""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"". For XML DTD [XML 1.0], applications must use the value ""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml"". Other schema languages are outside the scope of the W3C and therefore should recommend an absolute URI in order to use this method. ""schema-location"" [optional] A DOMString object containing a list of URIs, separated by white spaces (characters matching the nonterminal production S defined in section 2.3 [XML 1.0]), that represents the schemas against which validation should occur. The types of schemas referenced in this list must match the type specified with schema-type, otherwise the behaviour of an implementation is undefined. If the schema type is XML Schema [XML Schema Part 1], only one of the XML Schemas in the list can be with no namespace. If validation occurs against a namespace aware schema, i.e. XML Schema, and the targetNamespace of a schema (specified using this property) matches the targetNamespace of a schema occurring in the instance document, i.e in schemaLocation attribute, the schema specified by the user using this property will be used (i.e., in XML Schema the schemaLocation attribute in the instance document or on the import element will be effectively ignored). Note: It is illegal to set the schema-location parameter if the schema-type parameter value is not set.

42,"It constructs a low memory sketch from a stream of known length. To summarize the basic idea, it draws samples from the stream and maintains for each sample a lower bound and an upper bound on its rank in the stream. The known length condition is not strictly true. While the sketch is constructed for particular stream length N, this datastructure does not limit the number of elements can be inserted, but then in which case the accuracy guarantee no longer applies. To query, two family of functions are provided. The sketch structure also support parallel sketching: Example: If I have 16 data streams, each of size N/16 I can construct 16 quantile_sketches, each initialized with desired_n = N (note. N here! not N/16) Each sketch can then be ran on each data stream independently. Then all can be combined into one: The procedure thus seem like binary addition. By picking the size b appropriately for a given value of N and , At the end, all the sketches can be merged to get a sketch of error . Here is where we deviate from the paper slightly. The ""compress"" procedure has the advantage of decreasing the total amount of memory required, By finishing/finalizing with a simple merge, means that the resultant array could be much bigger than desired. The way the binary addition works, also means the resultant sketch size is somewhat unpredictable. Thus here lies the modification. We compute the sketch as usual, but sizing ""b"" to end up with a final merged error of  / 2. We then perform one addition compress(/2) phase to compress the final sketch into requiring only O(1/epsilon) memory.",1

A typical way to use this class follows: The ""LICSDetector"" object will visit every satellite in the GNSS data structure that is ""gRin"" and will decide if a cycle slip has happened in the given observable. The algorithm will use LI observables, and the LLI1 and LLI2 indexes. The result (a 1 if a cycle slip is found, 0 otherwise) will be stored in the data structure both as the CSL1 and CSL2 indexes. This algorithm will use some values as maximum interval of time between two successive epochs, minimum threshold to declare cycle slip and LI combination limit drift. The default values are usually fine, but you may change them with the appropriate methods. This is of special importance for the maximum interval time, that should be adjusted for your sampling rate. It is 61 seconds by default, which is appropriate for 30 seconds per sample RINEX observation files. When used with the "">>"" operator, this class returns the same incoming data structure with the cycle slip indexes inserted along their corresponding satellites. Be warned that if a given satellite does not have the observations required, it will be summarily deleted from the data structure. Be aware that some combinations of cycle slips in L1 and L2 may result in a false negative when using a cycle slip detector based on LI.

641,"There are two histograms that can be created: The above example creates the object it then proceeds to set one of the properties of the histogram. In this case the number of data points is specified with the keyword 'n', the 11 indicates we want the histogram to consist of 11 bins. To actually create the histogram the Command method is called a second time but because the 'set' keyword is not the first element in the vector of strings the tabulated potential object assumes it is a file name were the histogram will be written. The following labels (""bond1"", ""bond2"", etc...) specify the interactions to be sorted into the histogram. Running this code should produce a file named file1.txt containing two columns. column1 = the bin edge, column2 = the contents of the histogram Here, notice we are using the 'tab' keyword to indicate it is for the tabulated potential. We are also setting several properities. The temperature is changed from the default 300 Kelvin to 275 Kelvin. Smooth potential is set to 1 this has the affect of smoothing the potential after boltzmann inversion is done. If a value greater than 1 were used it would smooth the data several times upto the number specified. And the final setting was to make the tabulated potential periodic. The value ""1"" is converted to a boolean which is interpreted as true. Finally, the data is printed to a file called ""file2.txt"" which contains three columns: column1 = the bin edge, column2 = potential, column3 = the force",1

909,"This class computes the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) solution using a Kalman solver that combines ionosphere-free code and phase measurements. This class may be used either in a Vector- and Matrix-oriented way, or with GNSS data structure objects from ""DataStructures"" class (much more simple to use it this way). A typical way to use this class with GNSS data structures follows: The ""SolverPPP"" object will extract all the data it needs from the GNSS data structure that is ""gRin"" and will try to solve the PPP system of equations using a Kalman filter. It will also insert back postfit residual data (both code and phase) into ""gRin"" if it successfully solves the equation system. By default, it will build the geometry matrix from the values of coefficients wetMap, dx, dy, dz and cdt, IN THAT ORDER. Please note that the first field of the solution will be the estimation of the zenital wet tropospheric component (or at least, the part that wasn't modeled by the tropospheric model used). You may configure the solver to work with a NEU system in the class constructor or using the ""setNEU()"" method. In any case, the ""SolverPPP"" object will also automatically add and estimate the ionosphere-free phase ambiguities. The independent vector is composed of the code and phase prefit residuals. This class expects some weights assigned to each satellite. That can be achieved with objects from classes such as ""ComputeIURAWeights"", ""ComputeMOPSWeights"", etc. If these weights are not assigned, then the ""SolverPPP"" object will set a value of ""1.0"" to code measurements, and ""weightFactor"" to phase measurements. The default value of ""weightFactor"" is ""10000.0"". This implies that code sigma is 1 m, and phase sigma is 1 cm. By default, the stochastic models used for each type of variable are: For instance, in orden to use a 'full kinematic' mode we assign a white noise model to all the coordinates: In order to overcome the former limitation, this class provides methods to set different, specific stochastic models for each coordinate, like:",1

Accessing the class will launch a background thread that will continuously monitor for broadcast messages. The current set of data can be queried at any time. It is also possible to configure callbacks so that your code can be notified whenever a new client appears or disappears. This service is compatible with X-Plane 10 and 11.

The class is based around the Singleton design pattern, as you're likely to only ever need one instance and it's easier to call it from anywhere in your code.",1

14948,"A typical way to use this class follows: The ""XYZ2NEU"" object will visit every satellite in the GNSS data structure that is ""gRin"" and will apply a rotation matrix to coefficients dx, dy and dz of the design matrix, yielding corresponding dLat, dLon and dH for each satellite. Take notice that the design matrix coefficients dx, dy and dz were computed by the ""ModeledPR"" object, so that step is mandatory. Also, the ""XYZ2NEU"" class is effective when properly coupled with the ""solver"" object (be it based on LMS or WMS). In order to get this, you must instruct the ""solver"" object to get the solution using a geometry/design matrix based on dLat, dLon and dH, instead of the defaults (dx, dy and dz). The later is achieved defining an appropriate ""gnssEquationDefinition"" object and instructing ""solver"" to use it as the default equation definition.",1

14950,Base used for objects exchangeable via object references. Objects with active references may have methods invoked via the implemented dispatched method call mechanism. This system is OO-friendly and allows runtime polymorphism. Each object instance has its own dmc table (think c++ vtable) which may be be modified at runtime after initial setting by the ctor. One use is to swap out initial (compiled) methods for methods invoking lua scripted forms executed via the (future) embedded lua interpretor. In this form you get the javascript-esque object method redefinition capability. The other purpose is to allow proper OO inheritence in derived classes in the heararchy which may override previous bases' dmc table entries within their ctors. Since secure referencing requires a way to track object lifetime a registry reference is required for construction.,1

Aggregates historical data from individual related protocol-specific transactions such as an HTTP client transaction and the corresponding HTTP or FTP server transaction. Individual transaction information worth sending or logging should be recorded here, ideally without exposing other master transaction users to internal details of individual transactions. For example, storing an HTTP client IP address is a good idea but storing a pointer to some client-side job which maintains that address is not. A master transaction is created by a newly accepted client connection, a new request on the existing client connection, or an internal request generated by Squid. All client-side protocols, including HTTP, HTCP, ICP, and SNMP will eventually create master transactions. A master transaction is auto-destroyed when its last user is gone.",1

This one is dealing with the cases when a vertex is lying on a segment it doesn't belongs to, i.e. two neighboring segments are touching the third segment. The algorithm is generating a crossing point exactly at the vertex of each segment. This results in a sequence of CPoint-VPoint-CPoint which refer to the same place. First of all we need to make sure that the corresponding cross couples are sorted properly, because they will coincide and there is no way for the sorting function to find out which is the proper order. Then we have to deal with two general cases. Both segments are approaching from the same side - the K case. Then the crossing points should be removed. The second case is when the segments are piercing the third segment Then one of the crossing points and the vertex point are redundant and should be removed.",1

However, be aware that for example, you can have N=2 dimensional vectors, and M=3 dimensional images. So, if N != M, then do you really want to try smoothing? It might be better to set the sigma to zero if you don't wan't smoothing in all dimensions. As of 16/01/2010, also note, that we now extend InPlaceImageFilter. This is because with time varying velocity fields, on decent size images, you need a lot of memory. So, rather than have an input/output buffer, we use one buffer. But this filter defaults to OFF to minimise impact on other programs that are not using time varying velocity fields. Obviously, you need some memory to perform the smoothing, so each subclass should clear references as soon as its done.",1

The fiber controller can be started at any time, depending on whether RPC is used at all, etc. However, the fiber controller must be destroyed only after the RPC controller since the RPC uses the fiber control. The solution is to use a classical C++ pattern for static variable initialization: returning a static variable in a function.

Each resource can depend on any number of other resources to form an acylic graph. This is e.g. for meshes that use materials (and thus textures), and also for collision meshes that have procedural vegetation. The dependencies are discovered when loading the resource, and loading a resource will load its dependencies automatically. Therefore the set of dependencies of an unloaded resource is always empty.

A messenger has a set of public variables that determine its logging behavior with respect to both updates and events. Whether a transaction is logged, sent to a remote client or processed is independently controllable for updates and events.

15016,"BFGS is a quasi-Newton global optimisation method that uses information about the gradient of the function at the current point to calculate the best direction to look in to find a better point. Using this information, the BFGS algorithm can iteratively calculate a better approximation to the inverse Hessian matrix, which will lead to a better approximation of the minimum value. From an initial starting point, the gradient of the function is calculated and then the algorithm uses this information to calculate the best direction to perform a linesearch for a point that is ''sufficiently better''. The linesearch that is used in Gadget to look for a better point in this direction is the ''Armijo'' linesearch. The algorithm will then adjust the current estimate of the inverse Hessian matrix, and restart from this new point. If a better point cannot be found, then the inverse Hessian matrix is reset and the algorithm restarts from the last accepted point.

This class uses an internal buffer of RealType pixels for each line. This line is cast to the output pixel type when written back to the output image. Since the filter uses dimensional decomposition this approach could result in inaccuracy as pixels are cast back and forth between low and high precision types. Use a high precision output type and cast manually if this is a problem. This filter is threaded. Threading mechanism derived from SignedMaurerDistanceMap extensions by Gaetan Lehman",1
15026,"This class defines an interface to routines which compute a position and time solution from pseudorange data, with a data editing algorithm based on Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) concepts. RAIM ref. ""A Baseline GPS RAIM Scheme and a Note on the Equivalence of
Three RAIM Methods,"" by R. Grover Brown, Journal of the Institute of Navigation, Vol. 39, No. 3, Fall 1992, pg 301. The class is able to use GPS and/or Glonass satellite data, and assumes that the Glonass ephemeris is in the GPS frame but the Glonass clocks are in the Glonass time frame. If the input data is mixed (both GPS and GLO) then the solution has a 5th element, namely the GPS-GLO time offset, as estimated by the algorithm. If the data is not mixed (either all-GPS or all-GLO), this element is zero and has no meaning. An all-GLO solution will have clock bias in Glonass time; otherwise it will be in GPS time. Note that a problem can arise when processing a timeseries of mixed data by calling RAIMCompute at each epoch; it is possible that the RAIM algorithm may, at some epochs, happen to reject all the Glonass satellites or all the GPS satellites. In this case the GPS-GLO timeoffset is undefined (and returned as zero).",1
15028,"This class changes the reference base from an Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) system to a North-East-Down (NED) topocentric system, centered at the provided reference location. The NED system may be used when comparing the relative accuracy of a given GNSS data processing strategy. This is a ""right-handed"" system, and be aware that ""down"" is positive and ""up"" is negative. A typical way to use this class follows: The ""XYZ2NED"" object will visit every satellite in the GNSS data structure that is ""gRin"" and will apply a rotation matrix to coefficients dx, dy and dz of the design matrix, yielding corresponding dLat, dLon and dH for each satellite. Take notice that the design matrix coefficients dx, dy and dz were computed by the ""ModeledPR"" object, so that step is mandatory. Also, the ""XYZ2NED"" class is effective when properly coupled with the ""solver"" object (be it based on LMS or WMS).

15029,"The Hooke & Jeeves optimisation is the default optimisation, and is a simple and fast optimising method, but somewhat unreliable, which is often described as a ""hill climbing"" technique. From the initial starting point the algorithm takes a step in various directions, and conducts a new model run. If the new likelihood score is better than the old one then the algorithm uses the new point as it's best guess. If it is worse then the algorithm retains the old point. The search proceeds in series of these steps, each step slightly smaller than the previous one. When the algorithm finds a point which it cannot improve on with a small step in any direction then it accepts this point as being the ""solution"", and exits. It is recommended that you re-run the optimisation, using the final point of one run as the start of the next. The Hooke & Jeeves algorithm used in Gadget is derived from that originally presented by R. Hooke and T. A. Jeeves, ''Direct Search Solution of Numerical and Statistical Problems'' in the April 1961 (Vol. 8, pp. 212-229) issue of the Journal of the ACM, with improvements presented by Arthur F Kaupe Jr., ''Algorithm 178: Direct Search'' in the June 1963 (Vol 6, pp.313-314) issue of the Communications of the ACM.",1
15030,"Helper class to simplify the assembly of non-linear problems, and the evaluation of finite element fields. This class allows you, while looping over cells, to access temporary std::vectors of objects (of the same size of your quadrature formulas, and compatible with the type you specify in the getter functions) without having to declare each of them beforehand, and without having to reinitialize them as Sacado types if the type you require is actually derived by a Sacado type. This is very convenient, for example, if you plan to use Sacado to assemble Jacobian matrices. The following example shows you how to use this class: These objects are created the first time these functions are called with a unique identifier, and reused by reference all subsequent times, saving you the necessity to instantiate and initialize new vectors of the right type and size everytime you need to access finite element solutions. If you try to access the values before a cache_local_solution_vector is called, an exception will be thrown. This function handles correctly also Sacado types (both first order and second order derivatives), and automatically initializes their derivative. This allows you to access derivatives w.r.t. to local degrees of freedom?",1
15031,"This class computes the 'general' equations using a Kalman solver in the 'forwards-backwards' approach, where the provided data set is processed from 'past to future' and from 'future to past' several times. This approach improves the final solution because it takes advantage of a better phase ambiguity resolution. On the other hand, it is only applicable in post-process mode (of course). Actually, This approach can't improve the precision of the kinematic reciever's solution, for that the phase ambiguities are not continuous parameters, and the variance and covarince information from last cycle is not stored as a-priori values for this new cycle. In reality, ""SolverGeneralFB.hpp"" objects are ""SolverGeneral.hpp"" objects at their core, with some wrapper code that takes 'normal' forwards input data, stores them, and feeds the internal ""SolverGeneral"" object with a continuous data stream formed by several instances of forwards input data, ""mirrored"" input data (oldest is newest and viceversa), forwards input data again, and so on. A typical way to use this class follows: The ""SolverGeneralFB"" object will also insert back postfit residual data (both code and phase) into ""gRin"" if it successfully solves the equation system. A way to apply this feature follows:",1
15032,"At the beginning, the vector of the holes will have a size equal to the maximum number of pending holes. When an element is deleted, its position is marked as a pending hole and it is inserted at the end of the existing pending holes (or after the regular holes if there are no pending holes). When the maximum number of pending holes is reached, the hole's vector is flushed. First, pending holes are then converted to regular holes. The difference between pending and regular holes is that the position of a pending hole is just marked as empty, whereas the position of a regular hole contains the distance from the next non-epty element (to speed-up vector traversal). Once the positions associated to the pending holes are updated, pending holes are moved into the regular holes and all the holes are compacted at the beginning of the holes' vector. Finally, the vector is resized: the new size of the vector is the number of regular holes plus the maximum number of allowed pending holes. When a new element needs to be inserted in the element, first a suitable position is searched in the pending holes, if no suitable positions is found, the search is extended to regular holes. If, among the holes, there is no suitable position, a new element is added in the container.",1
15033,"This Class define the generic interface for a registration method. This class is templated over the type of the Mesh and the Mesh to be registered. A generic Transform is used by this class. That allows to select at run time the particular type of transformation that is to be applied for registering the Meshs. This method use a generic Metric in order to compare the Mesh and the Mesh. The final goal of the registration method is to find the set of parameters of the Transformation that optimizes the metric. The registration method also support a generic optimizer that can be selected at run-time. The only restriction for the optimizer is that it should be able to operate in single-valued cost functions given that the metrics used to compare Mesh with Meshes provide a single value as output. The terms : FixedMesh and MovingMesh are used in this class to indicate that the Mesh is being mapped by the transform. This class uses the coordinate system of the Fixed Mesh as a reference and searchs for a Transform that will map points from the space of the Fixed Mesh to the space of the Moving Mesh. For doing so, a Metric will be continously applied to compare the Fixed Mesh with the Transformed Moving Mesh. This process also requires to interpolate values from the Moving Mesh.",1

The queue events that are observable are: ""Enqueued"" - the message is ""Available"" - on the queue for transfer to any consumer (e.g. browse or acquire) ""Acquired"" - - a consumer has claimed exclusive access to it. It is no longer available for other consumers to browse or acquire, but it is not yet considered dequeued as it may be requeued by the consumer. ""Requeued"" - a previously-acquired message is released by its owner: it is put back on the queue at its original position and returns to the ""Available"" state.

15037,"The estimated rotation and translation transform the model from model-space to camera-space, and, if one wishes to use OpenGL, can be used to build the model-view matrix. The parameters are the inverse of the camera position in 3D space. The camera frustum describes the size of the viewing plane of the camera, and can be used to build an OpenGL-conformant orthographic projection matrix. Together, these parameters fully describe the imaging process of a given model instance (under an orthographic projection). The rotation values are given in radians and estimated using the RPY convention. Yaw is applied first to the model, then pitch, then roll (R * P * Y * vertex). In general, the convention is as follows: r_x = Pitch r_y = Yaw. Positive means subject is looking left (we see her right cheek). r_z = Roll. Positive means the subject's right eye is further down than the other one (he tilts his head to the right). However, we're using a quaternion now to represent the rotation, and glm::eulerAngles() will give slightly different angles (according to a different (undocumented)) convention. However, the rotation is exactly the same! (i.e. they are represented by the same quaternion / rotation matrix).

The input should be the output of itkLaplacianSolverImageFilter, but the filter will work for any scalar image. We simply compute the derivative using 2 point central differences, and normalize it to unit length. The output vector length takes into account anisotropic voxels, so the output vectors are in mm space, and hence are 1mm long. Additionally, we added a member variable UseMillimetreScaling, so that if true, the size in millimetre of the voxel is taken into account. Defaults to on. Additionally, we added a member variable, DivideByTwo, so that if true, the difference of the pixel + and pixel - is divided by two. Defaults to on. Additionally, we added member variable Normalize, which is a boolean to turn normalization to unit length on/off. Defaults to on. Additionally, we added a pad value. If the current pixel, or +/- 1 pixel in any dimension is == pad value, then the gradient is ignored. As of 25th Nov 2009, we have wrapped the classes GradientImageFilter and GradientRecursiveGaussianImageFilter. As of 1st Dec 2009, I have also wrapped smoothing of the vector field.

15039,"The date template represents an interface shell for a date class that is based on a year-month-day system such as the gregorian or iso systems. It provides basic operations to enable calculation and comparisons. This date representation fundamentally departs from the C tm struct approach. The goal for this type is to provide efficient date operations (add, subtract) and storage (minimize space to represent) in a concrete class. Thus, the date uses a count internally to represent a particular date. The calendar parameter defines the policies for converting the the year-month-day and internal counted form here. Applications that need to perform heavy formatting of the same date repeatedly will perform better by using the year-month-day representation. Internally the date uses a day number to represent the date. This is a monotonic time representation. This representation allows for fast comparison as well as simplifying the creation of writing numeric operations. Essentially, the internal day number is like adjusted julian day. The adjustment is determined by the Epoch date which is represented as day 1 of the calendar. Day 0 is reserved for negative infinity so that any actual date is automatically greater than negative infinity. When a date is constructed from a date or formatted for output, the appropriate conversions are applied to create the year, month, day representations.",1
15040,"Originally copied from ITK. Adapted to allow non-integer levels. The multi-resolution schedule is specified in terms for shrink factors at each multi-resolution level for each dimension. A user can either use the default schedules or specify each factor in the schedules directly. The schedule is stored as an unsigned int matrix. An element of the table can be access via the double bracket notation: table[resLevel][dimension] For example: 8 4 4 4 4 2 is a schedule for two computation level. In the first (coarest) level the image is reduce by a factor of 8 in the column dimension, factor of 4 in the row dimension and factor of 4 in the slice dimension. In the second level, the image is reduce by a factor of 4 in the column dimension, 4 is the row dimension and 2 in the slice dimension. 8 8 8 4 4 4 2 2 2 1 1 1 For example, for 4 levels and starting factors of 8,8,4 the default table would be: 8 8 4 4 4 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 When this filter is updated, NumberOfLevels outputs are produced. The N'th output correspond to the N'th level of the pyramid. Note that even if the shrink factors are all equal to one, a smoothing will still be applied. The output at the finest level of the pyramid will thus typically be a smoothed version of the input. This class is templated over the input image type and the output image type. This filter uses multithreaded filters to perform the smoothing and downsampling. This filter supports streaming.",1

15045,"The code for the TerrainSceneNode is based on the Terrain renderer by Soconne and the GeoMipMapSceneNode developed by Spinz. They made their code available for engine and allowed it to be distributed under this licence. I only modified some parts. A lot of thanks go to them. This scene node is capable of very quickly loading terrains and updating the indices at runtime to enable viewing very large terrains. It uses a CLOD ( Continuous Level of Detail ) algorithm which updates the indices for each patch based on a LOD ( Level of Detail ) which is determined based on a patch's distance from the camera. The Patch Size of the terrain must always be a size of ( 2^N+1, i.e. 8+1(9), 16+1(17), etc. ). The MaxLOD available is directly dependent on the patch size of the terrain. LOD 0 contains all of the indices to draw all the triangles at the max detail for a patch. As each LOD goes up by 1 the step taken, in generating indices increases by - 2^LOD, so for LOD 1, the step taken is 2, for LOD 2, the step taken is 4, LOD 3 - 8, etc. The step can be no larger than the size of the patch, so having a LOD of 8, with a patch size of 17, is asking the algoritm to generate indices every 2^8 ( 256 ) vertices, which is not possible with a patch size of 17. The maximum LOD for a patch size of 17 is 2^4 ( 16 ). So, with a MaxLOD of 5, you'll have LOD 0 ( full detail ), LOD 1 ( every 2 vertices ), LOD 2 ( every 4 vertices ), LOD 3 ( every 8 vertices ) and LOD 4 ( every 16 vertices ).",1
15046,"Widgets are drawable, interactive parts of the user interface. This is the base class for many many interface elements, such as buttons, labels, sliders, etc. It is recommended for widgets to implement Create static method, which returns a new shared_ptr of that object type, which simplifies the syntax for interface building. It shall be remembered, however, that a separate init() function may be destignated to be run once the constructor finishes, so that shared_from_this can work correctly (in case the this pointer is needed during initialisation, e.g. if a widget wishes to build a subinterface and parent pointers have to be filled). When implementing custom widgets you are expected to override CustomDraw with a specialized version. Do not implement your own Draw. If your widget has children and you wish to draw them too, use their Draw. Draw is basically a wrapper for CustomDraw, which performs visibility check, size clipping, resizing and texture caching. Use Draw, but write CustomDraw. When a widget gets drawn, the draw area size is guaranteed to be of exactly the same dimentions, as were set by the last call to CustomResize. Therefore you can use CustomResize to calculate your children size, but remeber to pass the resize event down to them, by using Resize. At the moment when CustomResize is called, the previous widget size is still stored in current_size, the new size is passed as an argument to CustomResize (but you don't need to correct current_size on your own).",1
15047,"Instead of using a default pixel value when a requested pixel value is outside the image boundary, like ResampleImageFilter, the filter uses the value at the nearest pixel. Note that the choice of interpolator function can be important. This function is set via SetInterpolator(). The default is itk::LinearInterpolateImageFunction<InputImageType, TInterpolatorPrecisionType>, which is reasonable for ordinary medical images. However, some synthetic images have pixels drawn from a finite prescribed set. An example would be a mask indicating the segmentation of a brain into a small number of tissue types. For such an image, one does not want to interpolate between different pixel values, and so itk::NearestNeighborInterpolateImageFunction< InputImageType, TCoordRep > would be a better choice. Output information (spacing, size and direction) for the output image should be set. This information has the normal defaults of unit spacing, zero origin and identity direction. Optionally, the output information can be obtained from a reference image. If the reference image is provided and UseReferenceImage is On, then the spacing, origin and direction of the reference image will be used. Since this filter produces an image which is a different size than its input, it needs to override several of the methods defined in ProcessObject in order to properly manage the pipeline execution model. In particular, this filter overrides ProcessObject::GenerateInputRequestedRegion() and ProcessObject::GenerateOutputInformation().",1

15051,"Also as in the no-atmosphere case, the albedo mode (with atmosphere this time) is used for the first pass. The reference geometry for this pass is normal incidence with no atmosphere, i.e., INC=EMA=PHASE=TAU=0 The second pass is going to assume implicitly that these reference values were used the first time, freeing the TAE reference parameters to define the conditions of finite incidence and maybe finite optical depth to which the output will be normalized. Figuring out the scaling that got applied to the topographic modu- lation in pass 1 turns out to be tricky because of the nonlinearity of the equations and the fact that the original DN (which would be recoverable from the atmosphere model immediately after pass 1) is lost after the divide filter. As an approximation, I will require the user to input ALBEDO, which is the average DN in the image after pass 1, a measure of the average value of RHO and, given the norm- alization, the average of the normal albedo in the area. Rather than do the calculation analytically as I did in my hand- written notes, I evaluate the contrast of unit slope numerically at given albedo or RHO; the first-order dependence on RHO has been divided out so this is inaccurate to second order same as the other derivation but it is a whole lot easier to follow). If it turns out to be desirable, we can define two values of ALBEDO for this program, one describing the input (i.e., giving the albedo for this one image, at which slope normalization is calculated) and the other describing the output (the albedo to be used in simulating the out- put image).",1
15052,"This is a class to detect cycle slips using LI observables. This class is meant to be used with the GNSS data structures objects found in ""DataStructures"" class. A typical way to use this class follows: The ""LICSDetector"" object will visit every satellite in the GNSS data structure that is ""gRin"" and will decide if a cycle slip has happened in the given observable. The algorithm will use LI observables, and the LLI1 and LLI2 indexes. The result (a 1 if a cycle slip is found, 0 otherwise) will be stored in the data structure both as the CSL1 and CSL2 indexes. This algorithm will use some values as maximum interval of time between two successive epochs, minimum threshold to declare cycle slip and LI combination limit drift. The default values are usually fine, but you may change them with the appropriate methods. This is of special importance for the maximum interval time, that should be adjusted for your sampling rate. It is 61 seconds by default, which is appropriate for 30 seconds per sample RINEX observation files. When used with the "">>"" operator, this class returns the same incoming data structure with the cycle slip indexes inserted along their corresponding satellites. Be warned that if a given satellite does not have the observations required, it will be summarily deleted from the data structure. Be aware that some combinations of cycle slips in L1 and L2 may result in a false negative when using a cycle slip detector based on LI. Therefore, to be on the safe side you should complement this with another kind of detector, such as one based on the Melbourne-Wubbena combination.",1
15053,"This filter computes a generalized variant of the distance transform with a squared euclidean metric. It can optionally compute a voronoi map as well. DEFINITION For a scalar function f, the generalized distance transform is defined as dt_f( x ) = min_p{( p-x )^2 + f( x )} If S is a foreground shape and we use an indicator function i( x ) = 0 if x  S,  otherwise then dt_i is the usual distance transform with a squared euclidean distance. APPLICATION The generalization is useful to create the union of spheres with different radis, for example. If r is a radius map and f( x ) = -r( x )^2, then the <=0 level set of dt_f is the union of all spheres implied by the radius map. This can be used in the context of group morphology with spherical structure elements that can vary in size across the image. ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION For an N-dimensional image, dt_f effectively computes the lower envelope of the spherical paraboloids of dimension N+1 with apexes at ( x1 ... xn f( ( x1 ... xn ) ) ) VORONOI MAP For the special case of dt_i, the paraboloids that participate in the lower envelope have their apexes on the foreground voxels. The voronoi map copies information from the apex abscissas to the whole region where the paraboloid is minimal. This information can be a label, a unique number, a position or anything else that is provided in a label map.

15054,"This Class is used to provide individual pseudo-random numbers to Processors on
an event-by-event and run-by-run basis. These may be used by Processors to 
seed their random number generator of choice. In order to use this service 
a Processor must register itself in the init method using:

       Global::EVENTSEEDER->registerProcessor(this);

and should retrieve its allocated event seed during processEvent using:

       int eventSeed = Global::EVENTSEEDER->getSeed(this);

and include the header file:

    #include ""marlin/ProcessorEventSeeder.h""                

The global seed is used for a complete job and is set in the Global steering parameters thus:

       <parameter name=""RandomSeed"" value=""1234567890""/>

Note that the value must be a positive integer, with max value 2,147,483,647
A pseudo-random event seed is generated using a three step hashing function of unsigned ints,
in the following order: event_number, run_number, RandomSeed. The hashed int from each step 
in the above order is used as input to the next hash step. This is used to ensure that in 
the likely event of similar values of event_number, run_number and RandomSeed, different 
event seeds will be generated. 

The event seed is then used to seed rand via srand(seed) and then rand is used to 
generate one seed per registered processor.

This mechanism ensures reproducible results for every event, regardless of the sequence 
in which the event is processed in a Marlin job, whilst maintaining the full 32bit range 
for event and run numbers.

If a call is made to getSeed( Processor* ) preceededing a call to registerProcessor( Processor* )
an exception will be thrown.  ",1
15055,"This operator migrates individuals from (virtual) subpopulations to other subpopulations, according to either pre-specified destination subpopulation stored in an information field, or randomly according to a migration matrix. In the latter case, a migration matrix is used to randomly assign destination subpoulations to each individual. The elements in this matrix can be probabilities to migrate, proportions of individuals to migrate, or exact number of individuals to migrate. If migration is applied by probability, the row of the migration matrix corresponding to a source subpopulation is intepreted as probabilities to migrate to each destination subpopulation. Each individual's detination subpopulation is assigned randomly according to these probabilities. Note that the probability of staying at the present subpopulation is automatically calculated so the corresponding matrix elements are ignored. If migration is applied by proportion, the row of the migration matrix corresponding to a source subpopulation is intepreted as proportions to migrate to each destination subpopulation. The number of migrants to each destination subpopulation is determined before random indidividuals are chosen to migrate. If migration is applied by counts, the row of the migration matrix corresponding to a source subpopulation is intepreted as number of individuals to migrate to each detination subpopulation. The migrants are chosen randomly. This operator goes through all source (virtual) subpopulations and assign detination subpopulation of each individual to an information field. Unexpected results may happen if individuals migrate from overlapping virtual subpopulations.",1

15058,"The defer intrinsic macro. Syntax: ""defer"" {statement} body... {statement} ::= block | syntax-unit+ If statement is a single block, the contents of the block are evaluated as described below. Otherwise, the statement resulting from the remaning syntax units in the defer statement are used. All statements following the defer are used as its body. Semantics: The defer macro has exactly the same semantics as try { body } finally { statement } Rationale: This defer construct is intended to serve much the same purpose as the construct of the same name in Go, providing a convenient way to guarantee destruction of a resource which is located in source immediately after its acquisition and which doesn't require adding another level of explicit nesting / indentation. Note that it has very different semantics than the defer statement in Go. Go requires the statement to be a function call and evaluates its arguments when the defer statement is encountered; Avalanche allows any statement (or even group of statements), but evaluates nothing until the defer statement is actually run. Furthermore, Go defer statements add elements to a stack of pending actions which occur when the function exits, while Avalanche's defer takes effect when the lexical scope is exited. In the majority of cases, the two end up being mostly equivalent. When they do differ, lexical scoping is felt to usually be more useful. The use of lexical scoping also greatly diminishes the need to evaluate parameters early; furthermore, evaluating nothing until the deferred statement is executed permits inspecting the results of the body. It is possible to construct a Go-like defer using Avalanche defer, but the reverse is not possible.",1

Patches sizes are equal to the receptive field sizes of inputs. For each input, a tensor with a number of elements equal to the number of patches is fed to the TensorFlow model. 2.Fully-convolutional: Unlike patch-based mode, it allows the processing of an entire requested region. For each input, a tensor composed of one single element, corresponding to the input requested region, is fed to the TF model. This mode requires that receptive fields, expression fields and scale factors are consistent with operators implemented in the TensorFlow model, input images physical spacing and alignment. The filter produces output blocks avoiding any blocking artifact in fully-convolutional mode. This is done in computing input images regions that are aligned to the expression field sizes of the model (eventually, input requested regions are enlarged, but still aligned), and keeping only the subset of the output corresponding to the requested output region. The reference grid for the output image is the same as the first input image. This grid can be scaled by setting the OutputSpacingScale value.

15072,"This is a class to detect cycle slips using LI observables and a 2nd order fitting curve. This class is meant to be used with the GNSS data structures objects found in ""DataStructures"" class. A typical way to use this class follows: The ""LICSDetector2"" object will visit every satellite in the GNSS data structure that is ""gRin"" and will decide if a cycle slip has happened in the given observable. The algorithm will use LI observables, and the LLI1 and LLI2 indexes. The result (a 1 if a cycle slip is found, 0 otherwise) will be stored in the data structure both as the CSL1 and CSL2 indexes. This algorithm will take a set of samples (between 5 and 12 by default) and will build a 2nd order fitting curve using a least mean squares adjustment method. Then, the current LI bias with respect to this fitting curve is computed, and the result compared with a time-varying threshold value. Such threshold value is computed using an exponential function with a given saturation threshold and time constant. The maximum interval of time allowed between two successive epochs is also used as criterion for cycle slip detection. The default values for threshold computing are carefully tuned, so you must not change them without a very good reason. On the other hand, it is very important that you adjust the maximum time interval to your sampling rate. This time interval is 61 seconds by default, which is appropriate for 30 seconds per sample RINEX observation files. When used with the "">>"" operator, this class returns the same incoming data structure with the cycle slip indexes inserted along their corresponding satellites. Be warned that if a given satellite does not have the observations required, it will be summarily deleted from the data structure. Be aware that some combinations of cycle slips in L1 and L2 may result in a false negative when using a cycle slip detector based on LI. Therefore, to be on the safe side you should complement this with another kind of detector, such as one based on the Melbourne-Wubbena combination. Given that this cycle slip detector needs a given ammount of samples in order to start working, it will declare cycle slips when its buffers don't have enough data. The minimum buffer size is 5 samples by default, so every time this detector starts, or when it finds a cycle slip, there will tipically be at least four successive epochs when cycle slips are declared.",1

DESIGN: instead of requiring sorting, since unordered_map (without multimap) has reasonable performance, we can build a multimap using unordered map by setting the mapped_type to be ::std::vector<::std::pair<Key, T> > // no compact vec - can't effectively sort by key when key is not there. uncompacted version of the vecmap internally has a single vector, sorted by (hash(key) % buckets) then by hash(key) then by key insert into back of vector. when insert, when map load_factor may trigger a rehash, we manually resort the vector and rebuild the map. note that as we are attempting to adhere to unordered_multimap template interface, we can't really add a comparacter parameter without causing problems elsewhere, namely in distributed unordered hashvec map. the transform that is inherently in the hash needs to be applied, else we might get into a situation where std::less results in 2 separate keys while hash lumps the keys together. we also cannot sort by hash value, because of possibility of collision.",1
